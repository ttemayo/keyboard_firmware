# keyboard_firmware
My personal keyboard firmware sources based on the QMK framework. I prefer to work on 30% ergonomic split keyboards.

This repository follows a little different approach then the recommended one. Rather then maintaining all layouts and user files in a big fork of the origin QMK repository, this separates the custom sources and combine it with a submodule. Thereby this repository here remains "independent" with a clean history focused on my personal configuration only. This does not mean I that I don't have my own QMK fork to work on new features or checkout other contributers work.
